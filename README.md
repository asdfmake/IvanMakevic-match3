# Match-3 Coding Challenge (Unity)
## by Ivan Makevic, makevic2003@gmail.com

This repository contains the source code and assets for a coding challenge focused on creating a **Match-3** type game using **Unity**.

For this project, I went with a **code-first approach**, focusing more on the logic and scripting behind the game than on visuals or polish. The main goal was to build solid core mechanics through clean and functional C# code.
